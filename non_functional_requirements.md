# Non-Functional Requirements for Metadata Extraction System

## 1. Performance

- **NFR1.1**: The system should complete the extraction of metadata from any supported document type (DOCX, PDF, PPTX) within a few seconds for standard-sized documents (up to 10 MB).
  
- **NFR1.2**: The system should maintain stable performance and not degrade when processing multiple files sequentially.

- **NFR1.3**: The system should handle large files (up to the size limit of each document type) efficiently, ensuring that processing time scales reasonably with file size.

## 2. Reliability

- **NFR2.1**: The system should perform its required functions under stated conditions for 99.9% of the time, handling typical user input accurately.

- **NFR2.2**: The system should manage and recover from errors gracefully, ensuring no data corruption or loss of significant functionality.

- **NFR2.3**: The system should have mechanisms to retry or handle partial failures, especially in reading or writing metadata.

## 3. Usability

- **NFR3.1**: The system should provide intuitive, clear, and consistent command-line interfaces, making it easy for users to understand and use the system without frequent reference to documentation.

- **NFR3.2**: The help and error messages provided by the system should be informative and guide the user towards the correct usage, especially in correcting input errors.

- **NFR3.3**: Documentation should be comprehensive, including examples of common operations and troubleshooting common issues.

## 4. Security

- **NFR4.1**: The system must sanitize all input file paths to prevent directory traversal and other common path manipulation vulnerabilities.

- **NFR4.2**: The system must securely handle the processing of XML data using libraries like `defusedxml` to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

- **NFR4.3**: The system must validate all input data to prevent injection attacks and other forms of malicious input manipulation.

- **NFR4.4**: Error handling should be secure, preventing the exposure of sensitive system information or error messages that could aid an attacker.

- **NFR4.5**: The system must ensure that subprocesses are invoked securely, preventing command injection and ensuring that external commands are run in a controlled manner.

- **NFR4.6**: The system should log all significant actions, especially errors and security-relevant events, to support auditing and troubleshooting.

- **NFR4.7**: The system must adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that it does not request or use more permissions than necessary to perform its tasks.

## 5. Maintainability

- **NFR5.1**: The system's source code should be well-organized, documented, and maintainable, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

- **NFR5.2**: The system should be modular, supporting clear separation of concerns and making individual components easier to update and test.

- **NFR5.3**: Automated tests should cover a wide range of inputs and scenarios, including edge cases to ensure the system is robust and maintainable.

## 6. Scalability

- **NFR6.1**: The system should be capable of handling an increase in load, such as processing larger files or a greater number of files, without significant degradation in performance.

- **NFR6.2**: The system should be designed to allow for easy expansion to support additional document types or metadata fields without major architecture changes.

## 7. Portability

- **NFR7.1**: The system should run on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification, leveraging Pythonâ€™s cross-platform capabilities.

- **NFR7.2**: Dependencies required by the system should be clearly documented and easily installable across these operating systems.

## 8. Compatibility

- **NFR8.1**: The system should be compatible with different versions of Python, especially Python 3.6 and above, without needing significant changes.

- **NFR8.2**: The system should ensure that its output is compatible with commonly used data processing and analysis tools.

## 9. Availability

- **NFR9.1**: The system should be available for use as a standalone tool at any time, requiring no network connectivity or external online services.

- **NFR9.2**: The system should handle routine maintenance and updates without significant downtime.

## 10. Disaster Recovery

- **NFR10.1**: The system should have a basic strategy for backup and recovery, particularly for its configuration and operational logs.

- **NFR10.2**: In case of a critical failure, the system should provide clear guidelines for recovery and continuation of operations.

## 11. Environmental Sustainability

- **NFR11.1**: The system should minimize its environmental impact by optimizing computational efficiency and reducing energy consumption during intensive operations.

- **NFR11.2**: Where applicable, the system should support policies and practices that promote environmental sustainability.
