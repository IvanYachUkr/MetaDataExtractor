### Non-Functional Requirements for MetaDataExtractor

#### Project Overview
MetaDataExtractor is a Python-based tool designed to extract metadata from DOCX, PDF, and PPTX files. This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the project as a whole, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

**1. Reliability**
- **NFR1.1**: The system should perform its required functions under stated conditions for 99% of the time, handling typical user input accurately.
- **NFR1.2**: The system should manage and recover from errors gracefully, ensuring no data corruption or loss of significant functionality.

**2. Usability**
- **NFR2.1**: The system should provide intuitive, clear, and consistent command-line interfaces, making it easy for users to understand and use the system without frequent reference to documentation.
- **NFR2.2**: The help and error messages provided by the system should be informative and guide the user towards the correct usage, especially in correcting input errors.

**3. Security**
- **NFR3.1**: The system must sanitize all input file paths to prevent directory traversal and other common path manipulation vulnerabilities.
- **NFR3.2**: The system must securely handle the processing of XML data using `defusedxml.ElementTree` to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks and XML bomb attacks.
- **NFR3.3**: The system must validate all input data to prevent injection attacks and other forms of malicious input manipulation.
- **NFR3.4**: Error handling should be secure, preventing the exposure of sensitive system information or error messages that could aid an attacker.
- **NFR3.5**: The system must ensure that subprocesses are invoked securely, preventing command injection and ensuring that external commands are run in a controlled manner using `subprocess.call` .
- **NFR3.6**: The system must use `zipfile` for proper file extraction handling to prevent Zip Slip vulnerability and mitigate Zip Bomb attacks.
- **NFR3.7**: The system must handle file content securely using libraries like `PyPDF2` and `pptx` to prevent buffer overflow and file corruption.
- **NFR3.8**: The system should log all significant actions, especially errors and security-relevant events, to support auditing and troubleshooting.

**4. Maintainability**
- **NFR4.1**: The system's source code should be well-organized, documented, and maintainable, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
- **NFR4.2**: The system should be modular, supporting clear separation of concerns and making individual components easier to update and test.

**5. Portability**
- **NFR5.1**: The system should run on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, iPadOS, Linux) without modification, leveraging Pythonâ€™s cross-platform capabilities.
- **NFR5.2**: Dependencies required by the system should be clearly documented and easily installable across these operating systems.

**6. Compliance**
- **NFR6.1**: The system must adhere to the relevant standards for DOCX, PDF, and PPTX file formats to ensure accurate metadata extraction.

**7. Documentation**
- **NFR7.1**: Provide a comprehensive user manual detailing installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting.
- **NFR7.2**: Include detailed technical documentation covering system architecture, module design, and development guidelines.
